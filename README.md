# Parkinson-oriented-3D-reconstruction-using-a-single-mirror.
Final thesis from a Bsc. Biomedical Engineering in collaboration with Yale University.

If you want to run the algorithm, first you need to configure the initial parameters
through "config.py". Then, the calibration can be done through "calibrate_video.py".
Whenever the calibration is run, the tracking and 3D reconstruction are ready to be performed through
"multitracking.py". 

The final analysis can be done combining "pca.py" and "plot_coords.py". 
"utils.py" is only used for reading purposes.
